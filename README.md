# twisted-todo

I wanted a program to keep track of things for me. Things I did, things I didn't do, things I should do, and most importantly things I need to do. But I wanted to do it differently than other programs, and I'm a programmer. So this happened.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/rhilenova/twisted-todo/wiki) for more information.
